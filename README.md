## Introduction
When visiting the link to our webpage you will be sent to our homepage with a image of a movie and then below, 40+ movies to click on. When you select a movie you will be directed to a new page that contains details and trailer/trailers of that specific movie.

- [The Project](https://rancid-tomatillos-pied.vercel.app/)

## Learning Goals 
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Application in Use
![Main_Page_FitLit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18154724/191154439-2dca5860-f244-4e14-8a22-5af9e0f02b65.gif)

## Setup
1. Fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button. 
2. Clone down the forked repo. To rename your project you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page running in your browser on `http://localhost:3000/`. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. 
7. Enjoy!

## Future Additions
- Search input that would filter what movies contained the title you are looking for. 
- Ability to filter by the movies genre. 

## Technologies
This project used JavaScript, React primarilary. Cypress was used when testing our application. Additional technologies learned specifically for this project included Router, Swiper.js, and React Player.
